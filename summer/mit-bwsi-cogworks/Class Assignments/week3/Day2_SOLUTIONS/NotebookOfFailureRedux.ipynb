    "Because the RNN sequentially iterates over the data, it can only ever have information about preceding tokens when making a predication.\n",

    "For length-1 sequences, the model simply needs to return $\\vec{x}_1$ as $\\vec{y}_1$, since the reverse of a length-1 sequence is itself.\n",

    "\n",
    "Simply put, the fact that the RNN processes sequences from sequentially from start to finish means that it is incapable of solving our toy problem!\n",
