    "# Encoding Text Documents to Numerical Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement methods that allow us to ascribe text documents numerical representations (a.k.a encodings). This will permit us to perform quantitative analysis on text documents and correspond this analysis to qualitative conclusions. E.g. two documents whose encodings have a small distance between them are likely to discuss similar subject matters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Arriving at methods for giving text documents numerical encodings will enable us to apply some of the powerful analysis and machine learning techniques that we learned during the Vision portion of the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Central to this encoding process is the observation that simply using **a \"bag of words\" approach - eschewing word-order and simply accounting for the word-contents of documents -** is often times sufficient for performing quantitative document comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoding arrived at by counting up the words in a document is aptly called the **term-frequency** descriptor of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see that there is plenty of nuance to how we will encode our documents. The way in which we construct our vocabulary, normalize our text documents before processing them, and provide weighting to our document descriptors will greatly impact our natural language processing (NLP) capabilities.\n",

    "### Removing Punctuation (Quickly)\n",
    "A straight-forward way to remove punctuation from a corpus would be to loop through all various punctuation (which is available, conveniently, in the built-in `string` module), and replace each punctuation character:\n",

    "In summary, we seek a method for giving documents numerical descriptors (arrays of numbers) such that they can be summarized and compared quantitatively. We identify a **vocabulary**: an alphabetically sorted list of words that occur in our documents. We typically filter from the vocabulary common **stop-words**, such as \"a\" and \"the\", which proliferate our documents yet convey little meaning. We also typically retain only the $k$ most common words across our documents. This will help limit the dimensionality of our descriptors.  \n",
