    "In 2017, Google Brain release a paper titled _Attention is All you Need_, where they departed from the traditional Seq2Seq architectures used in NLP and introduced a new kind of architecture: the transformer.\n",
    "As the title of their paper suggests, the transformer is based on attention mechanisms, and does not use any kind of recurrent states as in RNNs.\n",
    "This meant that a transformer could be trained significantly faster than a Seq2Seq model using RNNs, as sequences were no longer processed one token at a time, but rather all at once.\n",
    "It also significantly reduced the complexity of the models being worked with.\n",
    "As opposed to having complex Seq2Seq variations that can quickly become intractable, the transformer is composed of relatively straightforward matrix multiplications all the way through.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since their introduction, transformers have been taking over the world of NLP.\n",
    "GPT-3, a state-of-the-art language model capable of outputting text nearly impossible to distinguish from something human-written, is a massive transformer model.\n",
    "Transformers have also seen applications in other fields of machine learning like computer vision, as their expresive power is, well, powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will take a deep dive into the original transformer architecture, writing up our own transformer and applying it to the translation problem of decoding a cipher."
