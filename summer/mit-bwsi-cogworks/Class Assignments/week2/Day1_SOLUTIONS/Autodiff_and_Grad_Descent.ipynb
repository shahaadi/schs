    "All of the examples of MyGrad's mathematical operations laid out above behave _identically_ to their NumPy counterparts in terms of the numerical results that they produce.\n",
    "The difference is that MyGrad's functions were all designed to provide users with the ability to perform automatic differentiation through each of these operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to note that MyGrad's `Tensor` objects were written to \"overload\" the common arithmetic operators, such as `+` and `*`, so that you can use these familiar operators but actually invoke the corresponding MyGrad functions.\n",
