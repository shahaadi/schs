    "Before, we had to construct the parameters of our neural network manually; recall that we created a `w`, `b`, and `v` ourselves with randomly initialized numpy arrays. Additionally, we had to manually perform gradient descent in order to update our parameters. One of the main advantages of using a neural network library such as MyNN is that this sort of low-level implementation is already taken care of. Essentially, neural network libraries will package up the general form of various functionality we may want to use such as gradient descent so that we can focus on algorithmic developments rather than reimplementing gradient descent every time we want to train a network.\n",
