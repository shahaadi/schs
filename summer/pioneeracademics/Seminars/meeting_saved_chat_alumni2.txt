	"Rename yourself with your full legal name and your choice of breakout room 
	Optional: add your pronouns and/or your preferred name
	
	Example: 
	(HUM) Ryan (James) -he/him - King
	Ryan's full name is Ryan James King. He prefers to go by James and uses he/him pronouns. He is conducting research in history at Pioneer so he chose the humanities breakout room and labeled himself on Zoom with (HUM) at the beginning of his name. 
	
	
	(Put your desired breakout room FIRST and in parenthesis)
	
	Computer science and math -> (CS)
	Math -> (MATH)
	
	Physics, Astronomy, and Engineering  -> (PHY ENG)
	
	
	"
18:04:04 From Taylor Ye (co-host) to Everyone:
	"Environmental studies: environmental science, ecology, climate change studies, environmental economics, plant physiology, etc -> (ENV)

	Social sciences: business, economics, political science, international relations, media studies -> (ECON)
	
	Social sciences: sociology, anthropology, education, culture studies, psychology, gender studies, criminology - (SOC)
