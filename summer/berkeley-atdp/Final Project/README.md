# linearregression-orange
The final project I created for the Data Science Lab with R &amp; Python course; created by implementing linear regression with the Orange dataset in R.

Contains the Orange dataset in a .csv format, an R Markdown file containing my R code, and an R Markdown html file displaying the results of my R code.
